## Berlin Clock Kata

This is a remote pair programming kata I did with a friend to spike on some new training and dojo techniques in this dark time under the COVID-19 time.
The original kata is [HERE](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a1463678ba9145a670000f9).
The kata itself is a nice data structure problem to solve that I loved to solve in this way:
1. I created my E2E user centric picture of the problem on a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Mh0Tmrf5hZ7EE7cDF0q9Pqr-4i5x4bs_3K3jdR2eA8/edit?usp=sharing). The idea was to understand an incremental E2E approach to solve the kata in an User Centric point of view, decoupling complexity in an incremental way. ![berlinClock](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Berlin-Uhr-1650-1705.gif) So I came out with an Outside-In incremental test journey.
2. I tried to solve the kata on the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Mh0Tmrf5hZ7EE7cDF0q9Pqr-4i5x4bs_3K3jdR2eA8/edit?usp=sharing) without any IDE help. I only used a google doc plugin to improve the code highlight. The plugin is CodeBlocks.
3. I created a node-jest project from scratch and I gave it a try refining some minor typos.
4. Then I asked my friend to start a remote refactory in VSCode with LiveShare. We started to refactor from the tests to improve the readability of it and then we moved to an incremental code review to improve the source.
